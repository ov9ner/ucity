<H1>LETTER TO MY FUTURE SELF</H1>

<BR>

Dear <I>Sultan</I>,

<BR/><BR/>

<P>I hope you are well. If you are having some problems or difficulties or 
being stuck or have failed to do something, just remember that you can do 
it no matter what, and have been there before, and you overcame those 
problems.

With that being said, let me remind you how to solve the problems that you 
face and help you overcome them.</P>

<BR/>

<H2>HOW TO OVERCOME PROBLEMS?</H2>

<P>First of all, try ignoring your negative thoughts such as "This is hard" 
or "I can't do this". Second, try resolving the problem by asking your 
colleagues or your mentor or by searching about it in websites such as 
GOOGLE and STACK OVERFLOW.

If still you couldn't solve it by now, take a break and clear your mind, 
better yet get some sleep.

After that, if you didn't solve it by now, repeat the steps again.</P>

<BR/>

<HR/>

<H2>PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS</H2>

<P>Also remember that you have problem solving skills, for the reason that 
you have tackled some challenges and problems with building projects 
previously, and have learned and gained experience from them and how to 
deal with them.

Here some of them:</P>

<ol>

<li>have the patience and the persistence it.</li>

<li>Knowing exactly how to describe the problem.</li>

<li>Knowing how to analyze the problem.</li>

<li>Knowing how to search for a solution correctly.</li>

</ol>

<BR/>

<HR/>

<H2>GROWTH MINDSET:</H2>

<P>In Establishing a Web Developer Mindset project, I learned that success 
is achieved by developing skills and practicing, not setting back and 
saying that "I have the talent for it, why should I bother? "</P>

<P>Also I have to hone my skills by practicing more and more and solving 
more problems and that will make me become good at it.</P>

<P>Learning from mistakes is very important, I have to see mistakes as 
challenges to be overcome, rather than setbacks.</P>

<BR/>

<HR/>

<H2>GOALS:</H2>

<P>Finally, here are the goals that I want to achieve, hopefully in the 
near future:</P>

<ul>

<li>Benefit from this Nanodegree as much as possible.</li>

<li>Better understand the Front-End Web Development.</li>

<li>Build projects and maintain them.</li>

<li>Become a Full-Stack Web Developer.</li>

<li>Get a job as one.</li>

</ul>
